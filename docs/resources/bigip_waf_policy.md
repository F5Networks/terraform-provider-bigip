# bigip_waf_policy

`bigip_waf_policy` Manages a WAF Policy resource with its adjustments and modifications on a BIG-IP.
It outputs an up-to-date WAF Policy in a JSON format

* [Declarative WAF documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/waf-declarative-policy/declarative_policy_v16_1.html)

## Example Usage 

```hcl
resource "bigip_waf_policy" "test-awaf" {
  name                 = "/Common/testpolicyravi"
  template_name        = "POLICY_TEMPLATE_RAPID_DEPLOYMENT"
  application_language = "utf-8"
  enforcement_mode     = "blocking"
  server_technologies  = ["MySQL", "Unix/Linux", "MongoDB"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required,type `string`) The unique user-given name of the policy. Policy names cannot contain spaces or special characters. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot, dash (-), colon (:) and underscore (_). It will be `fullpath`, ex: `/Common/policy1`

* `template_name` - (Required,type `string`) Specifies the name of the template used for the policy creation.

* `application_language` - (Optional,type `string`) The character encoding for the web application. The character encoding determines how the policy processes the character sets. The default is `utf-8`

* `case_insensitive` - (Optional,type `bool`) Specifies whether the security policy treats microservice URLs, file types, URLs, and parameters as case sensitive or not. When this setting is enabled, the system stores these security policy elements in lowercase in the security policy configuration

* `enable_passivemode` - (Optional,type `bool`) Passive Mode allows the policy to be associated with a Performance L4 Virtual Server (using a FastL4 profile). With FastL4, traffic is analyzed but is not modified in any way.

* `protocol_independent` - (Optional,type `bool`) When creating a security policy, you can determine whether a security policy differentiates between HTTP and HTTPS URLs. If enabled, the security policy differentiates between HTTP and HTTPS URLs. If disabled, the security policy configures URLs without specifying a specific protocol. This is useful for applications that behave the same for HTTP and HTTPS, and it keeps the security policy from including the same URL twice.

* `enforcement_mode` - (Optional,type `string`) How the system processes a request that triggers a security policy violation

* `type` - (Optional,type `string`) The type of policy you want to create. The default policy type is Security.

* `server_technologies` - (Optional,type `list`) The server technology is a server-side application, framework, web server or operating system type that is configured in the policy in order to adapt the policy to the checks needed for the respective technology.

* `parameters` - (Optional,type `list`) This section defines parameters that the security policy permits in requests.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `policy_id` - The id of the A.WAF Policy as it would be calculated on the BIG-IP.

* `policy_json` - The payload of the WAF Policy


## Import
An existing WAF Policy or if the WAF Policy has been manually created or modified on the BIG-IP WebUI, it can be imported using its `id`.

e.g:

```
terraform import bigip_waf_policy.example <id>
```
