# bigip_waf_policy

`bigip_waf_policy` Manages a WAF Policy resource with its adjustments and modifications on a BIG-IP.
It outputs an up-to-date WAF Policy in a JSON format

* [Declarative WAF documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/waf-declarative-policy/declarative_policy_v16_1.html)

~> **NOTE** This Resource Requires F5 BIG-IP v16.x above version, and ASM need to be provisioned.

~> **NOTE** For BIG-IP v17.x above version,Terraform BIG-IP Provider version must be > v1.23.0

```hcl

data "bigip_waf_entity_parameter" "Param1" {
  name            = "Param1"
  type            = "explicit"
  data_type       = "alpha-numeric"
  perform_staging = true
}

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required,type `string`) The unique user-given name of the policy. Policy names cannot contain spaces or special characters. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot, dash (-), colon (:) and underscore (_).

* `template_name` - (Required,type `string`) Specifies the name of the template used for the policy creation.

* `description` - (Optional,type `string`) Specifies the description of the policy.

* `partition` - (Optional,type `string`) Specifies the partition of the policy. Default is `Common`

* `application_language` - (Optional,type `string`) The character encoding for the web application. The character encoding determines how the policy processes the character sets. The default is `utf-8`

* `case_insensitive` - (Optional,type `bool`) Specifies whether the security policy treats microservice URLs, file types, URLs, and parameters as case sensitive or not. When this setting is enabled, the system stores these security policy elements in lowercase in the security policy configuration

* `enable_passivemode` - (Optional,type `bool`) Passive Mode allows the policy to be associated with a Performance L4 Virtual Server (using a FastL4 profile). With FastL4, traffic is analyzed but is not modified in any way.

* `protocol_independent` - (Optional,type `bool`) When creating a security policy, you can determine whether a security policy differentiates between HTTP and HTTPS URLs. If enabled, the security policy differentiates between HTTP and HTTPS URLs. If disabled, the security policy configures URLs without specifying a specific protocol. This is useful for applications that behave the same for HTTP and HTTPS, and it keeps the security policy from including the same URL twice.

* `enforcement_mode` - (Optional,type `string`) How the system processes a request that triggers a security policy violation

* `type` - (Optional,type `string`) The type of policy you want to create. The default policy type is `security`.

* `server_technologies` - (Optional,type `list`) The server technology is a server-side application, framework, web server or operating system type that is configured in the policy in order to adapt the policy to the checks needed for the respective technology.

* `parameters` - (Optional,type `list`) This section defines parameters that the security policy permits in requests.

* `urls` - (Optional,type `list`) In a security policy, you can manually specify the HTTP URLs that are allowed (or disallowed) in traffic to the web application being protected. If you are using automatic policy building (and the policy includes learning URLs), the system can determine which URLs to add, based on legitimate traffic.

* `signature_sets` - (Optional,type `list`) Defines behavior when signatures found within a signature-set are detected in a request. Settings are culmulative, so if a signature is found in any set with block enabled, that signature will have block enabled.

* `signatures` - (Optional,type `list`) This section defines the properties of a signature on the policy.

* `policy_builder` - (Optional,`set`) `policy_builder` block will provide `learning_mode` options to be used for policy builder.
See [policy builder](#policy-builder) below for more details.

* `graphql_profiles` - (Optional,`list of set`) `graphql_profiles` takes list of graphql profile options to be used for policy builder.
See [graphql profiles](#graphql-profiles) below for more details.

* `file_types` - (Optional,`list of set`) `file_types` takes list of file-types options to be used for policy builder.
See [file types](#file-types) below for more details.

* `ip_exceptions` - (Optional,`list of set`) `ip_exceptions` takes list of IP address exception,An IP address exception is an IP address that you want the system to treat in a specific way for a security policy.For example, you can specify IP addresses from which the system should always trust traffic.
    See [IP Exceptions](#ip-exceptions) below for more details.

* `open_api_files` - (Optional,type `list`) This section defines the Link for open api files on the policy.

* `policy_import_json` - (Optional,type `string`) The payload of the WAF Policy to be used for IMPORT on to BIG-IP. 

### policy builder
The `policy_builder` block supports the following:

* `learning_mode` - (Optional , `string`) learning mode setting for policy-builder, possible options: [`automatic`,`disabled`, `manual`]

### graphql profiles
The `graphql_profile` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required , `string`) Specifies the unique name of the GraphQL profile you are creating or editing.
* `metachar_elementcheck` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies when checked (enabled) that the system enforces the security policy settings of a meta character for the GraphQL profile. After you enable this setting, the system displays a list of meta characters. The default is enabled.
* `attack_signatures_check` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies when checked (enabled) that you want attack signatures and threat campaigns to be detected on this GraphQL profile and possibly override the security policy settings of an attack signature or threat campaign specifically for this GraphQL profile. After you enable this setting, the system displays a list of attack signatures and and threat campaigns. The default is enabled.
* `defense_attributes` - (Optional , `Set`) `defense_attributes` block settings for GraphQl policy.See [defense attributes](#defense-attributes) below for more details.

### defense attributes
The `defense_attributes` block supports the following:

* `allow_introspection_queries` - (Optional , `bool`) Introspection queries can also be enforced to prevent attackers from using them to
  understand the API structure and potentially breach an application.
* `tolerate_parsing_warnings` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies, when checked (enabled), that the system does not report when the security enforcer encounters warnings while parsing GraphQL content. Specifies when cleared (disabled), that the security policy reports when the security enforcer encounters warnings while parsing GraphQL content. The default setting is disabled.
* `maximum_batched_queries` - (Optional, `string`) Specifies the highest number of batched queries allowed by the security policy.
* `maximum_structure_depth` - (Optional, `string`) Specifies the greatest nesting depth found in the GraphQL structure allowed by the security policy.
* `maximum_total_length` - (Optional, `string`) Specifies the longest length, in bytes, allowed by the security policy of the request payload, or parameter value, where the GraphQL data was found.
* `maximum_value_length` - (Optional, `string`) Specifies the longest length (in bytes) of the longest GraphQL element value in the document allowed by the security policy.


### file types
The `file_types` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Optional , `string`) Specifies the file type name as appearing in the URL extension.

* `type` - (Optional , `string`) Determines the type of the name attribute. Only when setting the type to `wildcard` will the special wildcard characters in the name be interpreted as such

* `allowed` - (Optional , `bool`) Determines whether the file type is allowed or disallowed. In either of these cases the VIOL_FILETYPE violation is issued (if enabled) for an incoming request- 
  * No allowed file type matched the file type of the request.
  * The file type of the request matched a disallowed file type.

### IP Exceptions
The `ip_exceptions` block supports the following:

* `ip_address` - (Required , `string`) Specifies the IP address that you want the system to trust.

* `ip_mask` - (optional , `string`) Specifies the netmask of the exceptional IP address. This is an optional field.

* `block_requests` - (Optional , `string`) Specifies how the system responds to blocking requests sent from this IP address. Possible options [`always`, `never`, `policy-default`].

* `trustedby_policybuilder` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies when enabled the Policy Builder considers traffic from this IP address as being safe.

* `ignore_anomalies` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies when enabled that the system considers this IP address legitimate and does not take it into account when performing brute force prevention.

* `ignore_ipreputation` - (Optional , `bool`) Specifies when enabled that the system considers this IP address legitimate even if it is found in the IP Intelligence database (a database of questionable IP addresses).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `policy_id` - The id of the A.WAF Policy as it would be calculated on the BIG-IP.

* `policy_export_json` - Exported WAF policy deployed on BIGIP.


## Import
An existing WAF Policy or if the WAF Policy has been manually created or modified on the BIG-IP WebUI, it can be imported using its `id`.

e.g:

```
terraform import bigip_waf_policy.example <id>
```
