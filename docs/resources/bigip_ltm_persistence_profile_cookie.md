  defaults_from                = "/Common/cookie"
  match_across_pools           = "enabled"
  match_across_services        = "enabled"
  match_across_virtuals        = "enabled"
  timeout                      = 3600
  override_conn_limit          = "enabled"
  always_send                  = "enabled"
  cookie_encryption            = "required"
  cookie_encryption_passphrase = "iam"
  cookie_name                  = "ham"
  expiration                   = "1:0:0"
  hash_length                  = 0

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [cookie_encryption_passphrase]
  }
}

`method` - (Optional) Specifies the type of cookie processing that the system uses. The default value is insert

`mirror` - (Optional) (enabled or disabled) mirror persistence record

`timeout` - (Optional) (enabled or disabled) Timeout for persistence of the session in seconds
