## Example Usage


```hcl

  name                = "tf_guest"
  initial_image       = "12.1.2.iso"
  mgmt_network        = "bridged"
  mgmt_address        = "10.1.1.1/24"
  mgmt_route          = "none"
  state               = "provisioned"
  cores_per_slot      = 2
  number_of_slots     = 1
  min_number_of_slots = 1
}


```
