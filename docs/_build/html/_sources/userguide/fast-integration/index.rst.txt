FAST Integration with Terraform
===============================

The objective of this template is to demonstrate how FAST can be used to manage, deploy, and log changes in applications
using Terraform as a resource manager through their API.

F5 BIG-IP Application Services Templates (FAST) are an easy and effective way to deploy applications on the BIG-IP system using AS3.
The FAST Extension provides a toolset for templating and managing AS3 Applications on BIG-IP.

For more information about FAST installation and usage, see the F5 BIG-IP |fast-docs| and |fast-AppSrvcTemps|.



**Example Usage**

::

   resource “bigip_fast_http_app” “app1” {
       application = “myApp3”
       tenant = “scenario3”
       virtual_server {
         ip = “10.1.10.223”
         port = 80
       }
     pool_members {
       addresses = [“10.1.10.120”, “10.1.10.121”, “10.1.10.122”]
       port = 80
       }
     snat_pool_address = [“10.1.10.50”, “10.1.10.51”, “10.1.10.52”]
     load_balancing_mode = “least-connections-member”
     monitor {
       send_string = “GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n” response = “200 OK”
     }
   }
