Scenario #6: Creating a HTTPS application with F5 BIG-IP WAF policy
====================================================================

The goal of this template is to deploy a new HTTPS application with Web Application Firewall policy on BIG-IP using Terraform as the orchestrator. Web application firewall policy and pool will be applied based on hostname or uri path.

Pre-requisites
--------------
On the BIG-IP:

- F5 BIG-IP version 16.1 or newer
- Credentials with REST API access

On Terraform:

- Using F5 BIG-IP provider version 1.16.0 or newer
- Using Hashicorp versions following :ref:`versions`

Create HTTPS application
------------------------
Create 4 files:

- main.tf
- variables.tf
- inputs.auto.tfvars
- providers.tf

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    
    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.
    
    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
