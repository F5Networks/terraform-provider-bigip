F5 Terraform Resources Overview
================================

:doc:`Install and use Terraform </userguide/installing>` for building, changing,
and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as
well as custom in-house solutions.

:doc:`Configuration files </userguide/configuring>` describe the Terraform components needed to run a single application
or your entire datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state,
and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine
what changed and create incremental execution plans that you can apply.

Use the following Provider resources to create, edit, update, and delete configuration objects:

- **BIG-IP 12.1.1 and later** - The code is open source and |f5_terraform_github|.
- **F5OS** - The code is open source and |f5_terraform_F5OSgithub|

.. F5 BIG-IP NEXT ##.## and later** - The code is open source and |f5_terraform_NEXTgithub|.
