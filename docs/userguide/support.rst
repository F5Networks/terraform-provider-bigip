Exposing confidential information
---------------------------------

When submitting a request for help or feedback, you should NEVER:

- Enter any private or personally identifying information about you, your network, organization, etc.
- Enter any passwords/credentials, logs, IP addresses, or servers/server ports.
- Expect that an F5 employee will immediately respond. Employees offer best-effort assistance, but there may be times when responses are delayed.

If you need more in-depth technical assistance, you can contact F5 Support.
