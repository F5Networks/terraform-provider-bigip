# Requirements
-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

# F5 BigIP LTM requirements

- This provider uses the iControlREST API, make sure that it is installed and enabled on your F5 device before proceeding.
- All the resources are validated with BigIP v12.1.1

# Documentation

Provider documentation and reference can be found [here](website/docs).

# Building the  Provider

Clone repository to: $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-bigip

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:F5Networks/terraform-provider-bigip

```
Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-bigip
$ make build

```
# Using the Provider

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to install it as a plugin. After placing it into your plugins directory, run terraform init to initialize it.

# Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need Go installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is required). You'll also need to correctly setup a GOPATH, as well as adding $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH.

To compile the provider, run make build. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the $GOPATH/bin directory.

```
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-bigip
...

```
# Testing

Running the acceptance test suite requires an F5 to test against. Set `BIGIP_HOST`, `BIGIP_USER`
and `BIGIP_PASSWORD` to a device to run the tests against. By default tests will use the `Common`
partition for creating objects. You can change the partition by setting `BIGIP_TEST_PARTITION`.

```
BIGIP_HOST=f5.mycompany.com BIGIP_USER=foo BIGIP_PASSWORD=secret make testacc
```
