# Documentation

Documentation for the F5 BIG-IP terraform integration is available at https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/orchestration/terraform/latest/

Terraform provider documentation is available at  https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/bigip/index.html

# Building the  Provider

Clone repository to: $GOPATH/src/github.com/F5Networks/terraform-provider-bigip

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/F5Networks; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/F5Networks
$ git clone https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-provider-bigip.git

```
Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/F5Networks/terraform-provider-bigip
$ make build

```
# Using the Provider

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to install it as a plugin. After placing it into your plugins directory, run terraform init to initialize it.

# Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need Go installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is required). You'll also need to correctly setup a GOPATH, as well as adding $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH.

To compile the provider, run make build. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the $GOPATH/bin directory.

```
$ GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor GO111MODULE=on make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-bigip
...

```
# Testing

Running the acceptance test suite requires an F5 to test against. Set `BIGIP_HOST`, `BIGIP_USER`
and `BIGIP_PASSWORD` to a device to run the tests against. By default tests will use the `Common`
partition for creating objects. You can change the partition by setting `BIGIP_TEST_PARTITION`.

```
BIGIP_HOST=f5.mycompany.com BIGIP_USER=foo BIGIP_PASSWORD=secret make testacc
```

more information about acceptance testing in Terraform.
